# Photo Stencil Generator  

## 📝 Overview  
This repository contains a **simple** Python script that converts images into stencil-like artwork, suitable for DIY projects, quick mockups, or fine-line tattoo designs. The code processes an input image and applies filters to create a stylized, simplified version that resembles a stencil or posterized effect.  

### ⚠️ Important Notes  
- **This is a very simple project**—results may not be perfect and might require manual touch-ups in an image editor (e.g., cleaning up edges, adjusting contrast).  
- **I strongly believe in supporting real artists.** This tool is intended for minor, non-commercial use only—such as personal crafts, quick prototypes, or educational purposes. If you need professional-quality artwork, **please commission an actual artist** instead of relying on automated tools.  

## 🔜 Coming Soon  
- **GUI Version**: A more user-friendly interface is in the works for those who prefer not to use the command line.  

## 🛠 Installation & Usage  
1. Install dependencies (OpenCV, NumPy, Pillow):  
   ```bash  
   pip install opencv-python numpy pillow 
   ```  
2. Run the script:  
   ```bash  
   python stencil_generator.py --input your_image.jpg --output stencil_result.png  
   ```  

**Remember: Automation is no substitute for human creativity. Support artists whenever possible!**
